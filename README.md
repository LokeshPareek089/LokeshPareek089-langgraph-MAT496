  ### Lesson 1: Simple Graph
  * Summary:
    I learnt concept of building a simple state graph using LangGraph. It explains how nodes represent states or tasks, and edges define the flow between these nodes, forming a directed graph
    that controls the sequence and conditional branching of agent actions.

  * Changes Made:
    Cheanged the output messages in each node.
    Changed decision logic from a 50/50 random split to a 90/10 random split.
    Changed initial state in graph invocation.
